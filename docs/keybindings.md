## Configuring keybindings
### Standard keybindings
Keybindings are configured in separate sections in `config.ini`.  Main keybindings section is `[keybindings]`.  
Key combinations are saved as custom syntax (very similar to emacs), that can be generated by running `endcord -k`.  
Syntax: `Mod1-Mod2-Mod3-Key`. Mod2 and Mod3 are optional.  
Modifiers: `C` - Ctrl, `M` - Alt, `S` - Shift. Keys can be uppercase and lowercase, uppercase doesnt indicate shift.  
Special keys: `UP`/`DOWN`/`LEFT`/`RIGHT` - arrow keys, `"ENTER"`.  
`Alt+Key` codes are stored as string with format: `"ALT+[KEY]"`, where `[KEY]` is integer.  
`Ctrl+Shift+Key` combinations are not supported by most terminal emulators, but `Alt+Shift+Key` are.  
Keybindings can also be chained like this (maximum 2 bindings in chain, separated with space ` `):  
`"C-y M-e"` which means: press `Ctrl+Y` then `Alt+E`, or `"C-y S-UP"`...  
To specify multiple keybindings for same action put them in a tuple, eg.: `("C-y", "C-y M-e")`.  
Switch tab keybinding is special - `NUM` is placeholder for 1-9 number keys, eg.:`M-NUM` or `M-y NUM`.  

### Configuring vim mode keybindings
Keybindings for vim mode are configured in section `[vim_mode_bindings]` can be typed as characters but they must be in "". Eg.: `"edit" = "e"`.  
In vim mode bindings, lone capital letter means Shift+key.  
There is one special keybinding, used only in vim mode: `"insert_mode" = "i"`.  
Command bindings can also use vim mode bindings, but they must be typed as key codes in quotes!  

### Command keybinding (macros)
There is additional section `[command_bindings]`, used to make custom client command string or even macros executed when keybinding is pressed.  
Command keybinding is added like this: `"C-x" = "send_message Hello World!"`. This will execute that command when `Ctrl+X` is pressed.  
Note that all bindings must be inside quotes, even a single integer. To use same binding as standard keybindings, set standard keybinding to `None`.  
Alongside commands, standard keybinding names can be used here too. Eg. `"C-x" = "tree_up; tree_up"` will "press" tree_up binding twice.  
To execute multiple commands in a sequence, type them separated with `;` character. To use actual `;` character in command type it as `\;`.  
Special commands available only for command-bindings are documented in [Commands list](commands.md#command-bindings-only-commands).
